# Portfolio Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy your portfolio to GitHub Pages and get a shareable public URL.

## üåê Live Portfolio URL

Once deployed, your portfolio will be available at:
**https://Joshi004.github.io/portfolio**

## üöÄ Deployment Methods

### Method 1: One-Click Deployment Script (Recommended)

1. **Run the deployment script:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

   This script will:
   - Check for uncommitted changes
   - Install dependencies (if needed)
   - Build the project
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages
   - Provide the live URL

### Method 2: Manual Deployment

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Method 3: Automatic Deployment with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions will automatically deploy your portfolio when you push changes to the main branch.

## üìã Initial Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository named `portfolio`
2. **Important:** Make sure the repository is **public** for GitHub Pages to work with free accounts

### Step 2: Push Your Code

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial portfolio setup with deployment configuration"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/Joshi004/portfolio.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

#### Option A: Using GitHub Actions (Recommended)

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. The workflow will automatically run and deploy your site

#### Option B: Using gh-pages branch

1. Run the deployment script: `./deploy.sh`
2. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
3. In the **Pages** section, select **Deploy from a branch**
4. Choose **gh-pages** branch and **/ (root)** folder
5. Save the settings

## üîÑ Regular Updates

### For Automatic Deployment (GitHub Actions)
Just push your changes to the main branch:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update portfolio content"
git push origin main
```

Your portfolio will automatically build and deploy!

### For Manual Deployment
Run the deployment script whenever you want to update:
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

## üåü Sharing Your Portfolio

Once deployed, you can share these URLs:

- **Main Portfolio**: https://Joshi004.github.io/portfolio
- **Direct Sections**:
  - About: https://Joshi004.github.io/portfolio#about
  - Experience: https://Joshi004.github.io/portfolio#experience
  - Projects: https://Joshi004.github.io/portfolio#projects

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **404 Error on GitHub Pages**
   - Ensure repository is public
   - Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
   - Wait 5-10 minutes after first deployment

2. **Build Fails**
   - Check for TypeScript errors: `npm run build`
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`

3. **Changes Not Appearing**
   - GitHub Pages can take 5-10 minutes to update
   - Clear your browser cache
   - Check the Actions tab for deployment status

4. **Permission Denied for deploy.sh**
   - Make script executable: `chmod +x deploy.sh`

### Checking Deployment Status

- **GitHub Actions**: Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
- **Manual Deployment**: Check the `gh-pages` branch for latest commits

## üì± Mobile Testing

Your portfolio is fully responsive. Test it on:
- Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- Tablet devices

## üîß Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain (e.g., nareshjoshi.dev):

1. Add a `CNAME` file to the `public` folder with your domain
2. Configure DNS settings with your domain provider
3. Update the homepage in `package.json`
